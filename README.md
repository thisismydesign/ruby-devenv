### Boxes:

ubuntu/xenial64 is broken:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-images/+bug/1569237

boxcutter/ubuntu1604-desktop is broken on VirtualBox:

https://github.com/boxcutter/ubuntu/issues/101

Furthermore there're several issues that slow the startup (e.g. 90 second timeout looking for swap device) so in the end it's faster to install Unity on an official ubuntu-server box one time than to have a slow startup every time.

### Currently using ubuntu/trusty64

### Want to use ubuntu/xenial64-desktop
